Some basic content outline:

BARRELS & BORDERS
Cross-Border Spirits, Done Right
EU–India Spirits Matchmaking. Executed in 90 Days.

Barrels & Borders connects European spirit producers with Indian bottlers at the exact moment tariffs collapse and opportunity opens.

With the EU–India FTA reducing spirits duties from 150% to 40%, we help both sides move fast — compliantly, profitably, and without inventory risk.

We don’t trade bottles.
We build bankable cross-border deals.

Why Now: The EU–India Spirits Opportunity

Tariff Arbitrage, Finally Real
EU base spirits can now land in India at commercially viable costs — unlocking immediate margin expansion.

A 3 Million Litre Market Gap
India’s urban premium segment (₹1,800–3,500 retail) is growing at 18%+ CAGR. Demand for consistent, “European origin” base spirits exceeds local supply.

First-Mover Advantage
Early EU suppliers and Indian bottlers secure brand positioning, shelf presence, and long-term contracts before the market crowds.

What We Do

Targeted Matchmaking
We pre-qualify EU producers and Indian bottlers to ensure technical, commercial, and regulatory fit.

Compliance & Structuring
FSSAI, state excise, labelling, origin claims — handled correctly from day one.

Deal Execution
From first call to trial container, we broker your initial shipment and set the foundation for scale.

No Inventory. No Guesswork.
We operate on a success-based commission (5%) — aligned to close real deals, not decks.
